/**
 * Approach
 * ----------
 * We adopt sliding window technique
 * will initialise a tempsum to zero and maxSum to zero
 * Will get the sum of n passed numbers from array and store it in the maxSum
 * And now, using sliding window, will loop through the array starting from num to end of array
 * and get the tempsum = maxSum - <old first index element> + <current available element>
 * now get the max b/w tempsum and maxsum and assign it to maxSum and repeat the process
 * finally return the maxSum

/**
 * minSubArrayLen
 * Step-by-Step Explanation:
Initialize Variables:
---------------------
minLength to store the minimum length of the subarray found. Initially set to Infinity.
left pointer to represent the start of the window.
sum to keep track of the current sum of the window.
Expand the Window:
------------------
Use a right pointer to expand the window by iterating through the array.
Shrink the Window:
------------------
Whenever the sum of the current window is greater than or equal to the target, update minLength and then 
shrink the window from the left by moving the left pointer to the right.
Continue Until the End:
-----------------------
Continue this process until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.
Result:
-------
After iterating through the array, if minLength is still Infinity, it means no valid subarray was found, so return 0. 
Otherwise, return minLength.

/**
 * Detailed Walkthrough:
 * ---------------------
 * Initialization:
 * ---------------
 * minLength is set to Infinity to ensure any valid subarray length found will be smaller.
 * left is set to 0, and sum is set to 0.
 * First Iteration (right = 0):
 * ----------------------------
 * Add arr[right] (which is 2) to sum. Now sum is 2.
 * sum is less than target, so move right to the next index.
 * Second Iteration (right = 1):
 * -----------------------------
 * Add arr[right] (which is 3) to sum. Now sum is 5.
 * sum is less than target, so move right to the next index.
 * Third Iteration (right = 2):
 * ----------------------------
 * Add arr[right] (which is 1) to sum. Now sum is 6.
 * sum is less than target, so move right to the next index.
 * Fourth Iteration (right = 3):
 * ------------------------------
 * Add arr[right] (which is 2) to sum. Now sum is 8.
 * sum is greater than or equal to target. Calculate the length of the current subarray (right - left + 1) which is 4. Update minLength to 4.
 * Subtract arr[left] (which is 2) from sum and increment left to 1. Now sum is 6.
 * Continue Shrinking:
 * ------------------
 * sum is still greater than or equal to target. Calculate the length of the current subarray (right - left + 1) which is 3.
 * Update minLength to 3.
 * Subtract arr[left] (which is 3) from sum and increment left to 2. Now sum is 3.
 * Subsequent Iterations:
 * ----------------------
 * Continue this process until the right pointer reaches the end of the array.
 * By the end of the loop, the minimum length of the subarray that meets the condition will be found. If no such subarray exists,
 * minLength will remain Infinity and the function will return 0.

/**
 * Alright, finding the longest substring with all unique characters using the sliding window approach is a classic DSA problem.
 * Letâ€™s break it down.
 * Step-by-Step Explanation:
 * -------------------------
 * Initialize Variables:
 * ---------------------
 * start pointer to denote the beginning of the window.
 * maxLength to store the length of the longest substring found.
 * charIndexMap to store the latest index of each character.
 * Expand the Window:
 * ------------------
 * Use a end pointer to expand the window by iterating through the string.
 * Check for Duplicates:
 * ---------------------
 * If a character is repeated, adjust the start pointer to ensure all characters within the window are unique.
 * Update the Length:
 * Continuously update maxLength with the maximum length found during the process.
 */

/**
 * Detailed Walkthrough:
Initialization:
start is set to 0 (the start of the window).
maxLength is set to 0 to keep track of the longest substring length.
charIndexMap is an object to store the most recent index of each character encountered.
Iterate Through the String:
First Iteration (end = 0):
--------------------------
Character is a.
Update charIndexMap with {'a': 0}.
Update maxLength to 1 (substring is "a").
Second Iteration (end = 1):
----------------------------
Character is b.
Update charIndexMap with {'a': 0, 'b': 1}.
Update maxLength to 2 (substring is "ab").
Third Iteration (end = 2):
--------------------------
Character is c.
Update charIndexMap with {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}.
Update maxLength to 3 (substring is "abc").
Fourth Iteration (end = 3):
--------------------------
Character is a, which is already in charIndexMap at index 0.
Move start to 1 (max(start, charIndexMap[a] + 1)) to avoid duplicate 'a'.
Update charIndexMap with the new index of a.
Continue This Process:
----------------------
Adjust the start pointer whenever a duplicate character is found.
Update charIndexMap and maxLength accordingly.
Result:
-------
By the end of the loop, maxLength will hold the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
This sliding window technique ensures the algorithm runs efficiently with a time complexity of O(n).
